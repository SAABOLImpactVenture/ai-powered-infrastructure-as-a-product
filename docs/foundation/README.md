# Foundation Gap Closure — Pack

This pack makes the solution production-credible by **codifying** identity federation, remote state, policy baselines with CI enforcement, evidence lake, landing zones, DR/HA, OTel, and cost guardrails.

Apply pieces independently; each folder contains real IaC or scripts.

- identity/* — OIDC/WIF for GitHub → Azure/AWS/GCP; OCI SAML federation with IAM policy.
- terraform/backends/* — Remote state with locks & encryption; output shows backend block to paste into modules.
- policies/* — Azure Policy, AWS Config, GCP Org Policy, OCI Cloud Guard with CI workflow to **fail on noncompliance**.
- evidence/lake/* — Durable evidence storage (Azure Log Analytics uploader, S3+Glue/Athena).
- landing-zones/* — Region allow-lists, org SCPs.
- networking/aws/failover_route53 — Health-check failover.
- products/* — Managed DB baseline with PITR.
- observability/otel/* — OpenTelemetry collector & compose.
- cost/* — Tags enforcement and budgets.

Wire these into your existing workflows to move from “demo” to “deployable.”
