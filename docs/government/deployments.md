# Government Deployments

This accelerator supports deployment into Azure Gov / AWS GovCloud / GCP Assured Workloads / OCI Government with the same patterns:
- OIDC/WIF federation for CI/CD (no long-lived secrets).
- Policy packs and Gatekeeper overlays as preventive guardrails.
- Evidence ingestion to compliant logging stores and OSCAL export for ATO packages.
