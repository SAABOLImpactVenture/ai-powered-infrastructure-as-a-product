# Executive Decision Brief

> **IaaS is what we buy; infrastructure-as-a-product is what we build.**

## Decision in front of leadership

Authorize a bounded, measurable validation of Infrastructure as a Product (IaaP) using one or more high-value infrastructure products, named executive sponsorship, explicit product ownership, and agreed stop/go criteria.

The decision is not whether to replace the cloud, infrastructure-as-code, service management, or existing engineering platforms. The decision is whether the organization should manage infrastructure capabilities as governed products with stable consumer contracts, lifecycle ownership, deterministic controls, evidence, and measurable outcomes.

## What problem are we solving?

Enterprises can buy cloud infrastructure quickly, but they still have to turn raw provider services into something that is safe, supportable, consumable, evolvable, and measurable. Without a product model, teams often inherit fragmented delivery paths, bespoke implementation choices, manual approvals, inconsistent evidence, unclear ownership, and duplicated platform work.

IaaP addresses the operating-model gap between **cloud services that can be purchased** and **enterprise infrastructure products that can be repeatedly consumed**.

## Why now?

Several pressures are converging:

- cloud estates are becoming more complex across providers, accounts, subscriptions, projects, networks, identities, and policies;
- AI can accelerate infrastructure work, but only safely when authority boundaries and deterministic controls are explicit;
- cybersecurity, compliance, audit, and evidence expectations increasingly require traceability rather than undocumented judgment;
- modernization programs need reusable platform capabilities rather than repeated one-off foundation work; and
- cost pressure makes duplication, unmanaged variation, and unclear cost-to-serve harder to justify.

## What is the proposed solution?

IaaP is a product and operating model that exposes infrastructure capabilities through stable, governed product contracts while preserving provider-specific implementation where it matters.

The suite separates four executive-level responsibilities:

| Capability | Executive meaning |
|---|---|
| **IaaP Guard** | Governance, readiness, assurance, evidence, materiality, and human review. |
| **IaaP Forge** | Infrastructure-product definition, composition, lifecycle management, and controlled fulfillment. |
| **IaaP Console** | Customer-hosted experience and management layer for consuming Guard and Forge capabilities. |
| **FoundationTarget** | Explicit target for attaching to or vending governed cloud foundations and managing their lifecycle. |

## What business outcomes should leadership expect?

The suite is intended to improve outcomes that executives can measure rather than merely introduce new technology.

Priority measures include:

- time from approved demand to a Ready infrastructure product;
- product adoption and reuse;
- policy rejection and exception rates;
- failed reconciliation and recovery rates;
- evidence completeness and audit traceability;
- upgrade, teardown, and lifecycle success;
- infrastructure-product cost-to-serve; and
- consumer experience and support demand.

No universal percentage improvement is asserted in advance. A bounded pilot should establish the organization's own baseline and determine whether benefits are material.

## What does IaaP replace?

IaaP is not a replacement for AWS, Azure, GCP, Crossplane, Terraform, HCP Terraform, GitHub, Backstage, ITSM, CMDBs, security platforms, or cloud-native controls.

Those can remain implementation mechanisms or enterprise systems of record. IaaP provides the **product contract, governance, lifecycle, evidence, and consumer operating model** that connects them around a supported outcome.

## How does AI fit without becoming an uncontrolled authority?

The authority model is intentionally bounded:

> **AI proposes and explains. Deterministic controls validate. Authorized people approve. The control plane reconciles. Cloud-native controls enforce the final boundary.**

This keeps AI useful for translation, explanation, diagnosis, evidence assembly, and product learning without allowing a model to become an independent infrastructure authority.

## What does adoption require?

A first adoption does not require a wholesale platform replacement. Leadership should select a bounded product or journey with:

- a known consumer;
- an accountable product owner;
- a responsible engineering owner;
- defined security and approval authority;
- a measurable baseline;
- explicit success and stop criteria; and
- a target environment in which the organization already has lawful authority to operate.

## Principal risks

| Risk | Executive response |
|---|---|
| Building another platform with weak adoption | Start from a real consumer journey and measure reuse and demand. |
| Over-automation | Preserve deterministic controls and authorized human approval for material actions. |
| Tool duplication | Treat existing enterprise tools as integrations or implementation mechanisms where justified. |
| Provider abstraction becoming lowest-common-denominator | Preserve common product semantics while allowing provider-native implementation differences. |
| Unclear ownership | Require product, engineering, security, operations, and lifecycle accountability before scale. |
| Benefits remain theoretical | Use bounded production-representative validation with baseline metrics before broader investment. |

## Executive ask

Authorize a phased validation of IaaP around a bounded infrastructure product or customer journey. Require a baseline, named owners, explicit authority boundaries, evidence collection, outcome metrics, and a leadership review before broader adoption.

The first executive question should not be **"Can we build it?"**

It should be **"Does managing infrastructure this way produce enough measurable value to justify scaling it?"**
