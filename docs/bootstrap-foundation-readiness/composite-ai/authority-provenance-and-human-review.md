# Composite AI authority, provenance, and human review

**Requirement IDs:** `BFR-AI-020` through `BFR-AI-029`

## Requirement

The customer must be able to distinguish source evidence, AI interpretation, deterministic validation, human authorization, and execution evidence. Those records must not be collapsed into one undifferentiated result.

## Authority separation

| Layer | May do | Must not do |
|---|---|---|
| Composite AI | interpret, propose, explain, summarize | approve, execute, accept risk |
| Deterministic policy | test explicit rules and schemas | infer organizational intent or waive failure |
| Human authority | authorize material decisions within assigned responsibility | hide or silently override failed controls |
| Product control plane | reconcile an authorized contract | redefine intent or manufacture approval |
| Cloud control | enforce provider configuration | represent customer governance by itself |

## Provenance chain

Each retained result should link:

```text
source evidence
  → AI proposal and assumptions
  → deterministic validation
  → named human disposition
  → authorized product revision
  → execution and operational evidence
```

The record must make later edits, superseded proposals, expired approvals, and incomplete evidence visible.

## Human review requirements

Material decisions require reviewers appropriate to the subject. Examples include:

- architecture authority for trust boundaries and integration patterns;
- security authority for privilege, exposure, encryption, and event handling;
- data owner for classification and model use;
- operations owner for support, recovery, and incident response;
- financial owner for budgets and lifecycle cost; and
- risk authority for an explicitly documented exception.

One person may hold more than one role only when the customer permits it and the resulting separation-of-duties risk is recorded.

## Deterministic validation target

Validation should verify that a proposal identifies its sources and assumptions, the required reviewer roles are populated, approval has not expired, the authorized revision matches the proposed revision, and the execution record points to that authorized revision.

## Required evidence

- immutable or integrity-protected source references;
- proposal and model-adapter identifiers;
- validation results;
- reviewer identity, role, decision, scope, and time;
- exception and expiration data where applicable;
- authorized revision identity; and
- resulting status/evidence identity.

## FoundationReadinessDecision behavior

- `CONTINUE`: the complete authority and provenance chain exists for the stage.
- `CONTINUE_WITH_CONDITIONS`: non-executing analysis may proceed while a named reviewer or evidence item remains pending.
- `STOP`: execution is requested without valid authorization, provenance cannot be reconstructed, or AI output is represented as human approval.

## Forge handoff

The handoff should contain only an approved, versioned product contract plus authorization and evidence references. Prompts, hidden reasoning, raw secrets, or unapproved alternatives must not become execution input.
