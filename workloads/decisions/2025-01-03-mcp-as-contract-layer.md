# ADR: Model Context Protocol as Contract Layer
**Date:** 2025-01-03  
**Status:** Proposed

## Context
Agentic tooling needs a standard connector pattern to infrastructure evidence.

## Decision
Standardize on **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** abstractions for tool contracts (even if adapters are used behind the scenes).

## Consequences
- Decouples tools from specific SDKs
- Consistent negotiable contracts for agents
