# ADR: Azure Arc as Execution-Plane Bridge
**Date:** 2025-01-01  
**Status:** Accepted

## Context
We require consistent policy and inventory across heterogeneous estates.

## Decision
Adopt **Azure Arc** to project non-Azure resources into Azure for inventory, policy, and evidence collection.

## Consequences
- Unified inventory & tags
- Policy assignment via Arc
- Minimal friction for hybrid evidence routing
