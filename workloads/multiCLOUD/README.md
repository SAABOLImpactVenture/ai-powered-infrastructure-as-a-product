# Multi-Cloud Reference

We treat **Azure as the control plane** (governance, identity, policy) and permit execution on other clouds when it delivers value. This repo focuses on **evidence** and **repeatability** so the control plane can assert conformance across diverse execution planes.

**Key Practices**

- Tagging strategy is uniform across planes.
- Evidence is normalized and centralized.
- Policy as Code is tested via the Golden Demo before rollout.
