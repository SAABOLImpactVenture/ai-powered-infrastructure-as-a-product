# Workloads

This folder contains **production-ready** patterns and code for four pillars that this accelerator enables:

1. **Agents · MCP · Azure OpenAI (AOAI)** – autonomous planning/apply loops with explainability and evidence.
2. **Infrastructure‑as‑a‑Product (IaaP)** – productized, secure‑by‑default modules and Backstage templates.
3. **Identity** – short‑lived, federated credentials across Azure/AWS/GCP/OCI (no long‑lived secrets).
4. **Multi‑Cloud** – orchestration patterns to plan → policy‑check → apply across clouds.

Each subfolder contains runnable code, CI, and docs. No placeholders.
