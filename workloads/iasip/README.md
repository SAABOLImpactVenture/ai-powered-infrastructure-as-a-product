# Infrastructure-as-a-Product (IaaP) Notes

**Mindset shift:** infra components are raw ingredients; the **product** is the curated, reliable experience delivered to app teams. This repo packages demos, evidence, and SOPs to make that experience auditable and repeatable.

**What "product" means here**

- Clear docs and runbooks
- SLAs/SLOs and evidence
- Opinionated defaults and paved paths
